<p align="center">A simple, in-your-face clock for time management.</p><br>

## ⭐️ Why
It's part of my personal productivity needs. I like having a gentle reminder about how much time I have left to do whatever or how long I've spent working on something. I don't want a whole whack-load of alarms to keep track of. I just want an easy, to-the-point reference. Maybe this tool will help someone else too.

This project is an opportunity to experiment with sounds, CSS nesting, and making an app that uses options to customize the user experience.

### Set-up
1. Clone down this new repo, or whatever you wanna do to get the code.
2. Install dependencies `npm i`
3. To run the localhost development server: `npm start` (http://localhost:666/)
4. To bundle everything for production, run: `npm run build`, however code added to the main branch will automatically be deployed.
