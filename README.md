## ⭐️ Why
It's part of my personal productivity needs. I like having a gentle reminder about how much time I have left to do whatever or how long I've spent working on something. I don't want a whole whack-load of alarms to keep track of. I just want an easy, to-the-point reference. Maybe this tool will help someone else too.

Most of all, this is a project for learning and experimenting.

## 🏗 Development
This project is an opportunity to experiment with sounds, CSS nesting, and making an app that uses options to customize the user experience.

### Set-up
1. Clone down this new repo, or whatever you wanna do to get the code.
2. Install dependencies `npm i`
3. To run the localhost development server: `npm start` (http://localhost:666/)
4. To bundle everything for production, run: `npm run build`, however code added to the main branch will automatically be deployed.
