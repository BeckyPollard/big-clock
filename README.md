<div align="center">
  <p>A simple, in-your-face clock for time management.</p>
</div>

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Why
It's part of my personal productivity needs. I like having a gentle reminder about how much time I have left to do whatever or how long I've spent working on something. I don't want a whole whack-load of alarms to keep track of. I just want an easy, to-the-point reference stuck on my second monitor. Maybe this tool will help someone else too.

Most of all, this is a project for learning and experimenting. I tried out **native nesting styles in CSS** (not yet), deploying a GitHub project to a Netlify-hosted website subdirectory, worked with audio in JavaScript, and tinkered with saving user settings to the browser storage.

No trackers, no guff, no nonsence... just a simple JS clock. Pairs well with the [Plash](https://github.com/sindresorhus/Plash) Mac app that makes any website your desktop wallpaper.
